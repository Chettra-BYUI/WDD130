        </h2>
        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>will people come to your site?</strong><br>
        <p> Yes people come to visit my site to plan their weddings. They will also source information available. They
            can look for vendors and other wedding planning resources. Friends and relatives of couple can also come
            visit the site assist the bride and grooms ond their wedding.</p>
        <strong> What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</strong><br>
        <p>Vistors will ask about how to manage the number of people at a wedding. They will ask about the customary
            ways to serve certain food or flowers arrangements. They would like to see samples of center pieces.
            Pictures of wedding dresses and other attires. I think might ask for security to prevent wedding crushers.
            Many of these questions maybe answered on a blog or a Q/A page. </p>
        <strong>What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?</strong> <br>
        <p> Visitors will look for a calendar to determine dates. They also would like to have a way to register guess
            contacts. The home page can provide them a link to add guest registrations. They will also look for ideas
            for games to entertain the wedding party such as DJ or wedding singer. They probably would like to fill out
            a mock menue, or schedule for the wedding dinner. </p>

        <strong> What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</strong><br>
        <p>The guests would need to sign up for an account that requires their first name, last name, and email address.
            They will also fill out a guest list, if they would like to use other tools. However, this information is
            private and the site will not use them for commercial purposes. When planning the wedding, the site will ask
            for the wedding date, location, and venue.</p>


        <strong>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the
            actions?</strong><br>
        <p>My site will have no or minimal advertisting. I put my customer first. I will offer a lot of starter free
            services, and customers can have the options upgrade for additional services if they already exhuasted the
            free services. The site will not use hard to understand terms or complicated sales tactics. </p>

        <p>
            The home page will dispay general information about the wedding planning business.
            It will have log in information. Navagation bar to get other sub pages. The other pages includes a resource
            for wedding dress shopping. Also a site how to plan a wedding if you and your partner live in different
            countries. It will show pictures of people getting married.
            It will also have a video link. And an area to show the best voted married couple of the month.
